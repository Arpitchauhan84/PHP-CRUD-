The CRUD operations in PHP refer to the basic operations performed on a database using the PHP programming language. CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These operations correspond to the fundamental actions performed on the data in a database.

In PHP, these operations are typically performed using extensions such as PDO (PHP Data Objects) or MySQLi to connect to the database and execute SQL queries. Here's a brief overview of each operation:

Create: This operation involves inserting new data into the database using the SQL INSERT query.

Read: This operation involves retrieving data from the database using the SQL SELECT query.

Update: This operation involves modifying existing data in the database using the SQL UPDATE query.

Delete: This operation involves deleting data from the database using the SQL DELETE query.

In PHP, to perform these operations, you can use standard SQL queries with the functions provided by the PDO or MySQLi extensions to connect to the database, prepare and execute queries, and handle the results.
